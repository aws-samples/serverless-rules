Amazon API Gateway Rules
========================

## Logging

Amazon API Gateway can send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for centralization.

## Structured Logging

You can customize the log format that Amazon API Gateway uses to send logs. Structured logging makes it easier to derive queries to answer arbitrary questions about the health of your application.

## Tracing

Amazon API Gateway can emit traces to AWS X-Ray, which enable visualizing service maps for faster troubleshooting.
