Serverless Rules
================

The __Serverless Rules__ are a compilation of rules to validate infrastructure as code template against recommended practices. This currently provides a module for [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint) and a plugin for [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint).

You can find a list of currently supported rules [in the documentation](docs/rules.md).
